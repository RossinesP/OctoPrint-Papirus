# OctoPrint-Papirus

This plugins displays the progress of slicing and printing operations on a 2.7" [PaPiRus](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/papirus-epaper-eink-screen-hat-for-raspberry-pi/) screen.
Support for smaller screens *might* come one day.

This is work in progress and for the moment, only the slicing process will display anything.

## Setup

First follow the steps to setup PaPiRus on the server :
https://github.com/RossinesP/PaPiRus
Use the Octoprint's pip command to install the package instead of the system-wide pip.
Test the installation by sending commands to your screen using the papirus-write or papirus-draw commands.

Then install manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/RossinesP/OctoPrint-Papirus/archive/master.zip

## Configuration

There is nothing to configure right now.
